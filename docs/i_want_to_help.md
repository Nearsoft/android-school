# I want to help

We welcome all the help we can get. Here are a few way in which you can help.

## Improve our Code Labs or create new ones

Code labs are small ordered exercises that assistants have to complete over the 6 sessions.

If you want to create a new one:

1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/Nearsoft/androidschool/issues) with your proposal (for discussion)
2. Fork the repository and create a new branch
3. Add a new folder to the corresponding event. If there is no event for your idea/app create it.
4. Add a subdirectory for the code lab named: `codelab`
5. Use an ordered way to categorize your exercises, example: `25Feb2017` or `day_one`
6. Inside of each day, add one Markdown file per topic like in this [example](/2017/feb_event/todoapp/codelab/25Feb2017/01_setup.md)
7. Create a pull request to the `master` branch and tag someone from the team

Note: Don't mix languages in your documentation. If you want to provide instructions in different ones please create different folders for them.

## Propose new (simple) app ideas for future classes

If you have an idea for a simple app, for example:

* A foursquare clone
* A TODO list app
* An alarm manager

Create an [issue](https://github.com/Nearsoft/androidschool/issues) with your proposal and the following details:

* Description
* Libraries/dependencies needed
* Some sketches
* Code: not required if not a developer

## Give a talk

Be sure to have your slides ready, for example:

* [Android School intro](http://slides.com/josesalcido-1/android-4#/)
* [Java and the Object Oriented Programming Principle](http://slides.com/josesalcido-1/object-oriented-programming#/)

And create an [issue](https://github.com/Nearsoft/androidschool/issues) with your proposal.
